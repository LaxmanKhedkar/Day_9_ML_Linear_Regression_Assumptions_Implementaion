# 📊 Linear Regression Assumptions – Theory & Implementation

This repository contains a detailed walkthrough of **Linear Regression Assumptions**, including theory (slides/notes) and hands-on implementation in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 📌 Project Overview 

Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental and widely used algorithms in machine learning. However, for it to work correctly, certain **assumptions** about the data must be met. This repository covers:

- **Theoretical Understanding** of Linear Regression assumptions  
- **Step-by-Step Implementation** using Python  
- **Visualization & Statistical Tests** for validating assumptions  

---

## 📚 Assumptions Covered

1. **Linear Relationship** – The relationship between independent and dependent variables should be linear.
2. **No Multicollinearity** – Independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other.
3. **Normality of Residuals** – The residuals (errors) should follow a normal distribution.
4. **Homoscedasticity** – The residuals should have constant variance across all levels of the independent variable.
5. **No Autocorrelation** – The residuals should not be correlated with each other (no pattern in errors).

## 🧠 Theory Highlights

📖 **Slides Summary** (from `Linear Regression Assumptions.pdf`):
- **Linear Relationship** → Tested using Pearson Correlation (R-value).
- **Multicollinearity** → Checked using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF > 5 indicates multicollinearity).
- **Normality of Residuals** → Tested using visual plots (Histogram/Distplot/Q-Q Plot).
- **Homoscedasticity** → Checked by plotting residuals vs predicted values.
- **Autocorrelation** → Checked using Durbin-Watson statistic or residual plots.

## ⚙️ Implementation Details

📓 **Notebook**: `Linear Regression Assumption-implementation.ipynb`

Key steps implemented:
- Load dataset and perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Check for **linearity** using correlation heatmaps & pairplots
- Compute **VIF** to detect multicollinearity
- Fit a **Linear Regression Model** and calculate residuals
- Plot **residual distribution** to check normality
- Plot **residuals vs predicted values** for homoscedasticity
- Check for **autocorrelation** using Durbin-Watson test
